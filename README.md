Topic About the Creating the Replica of the BBC News Website with includes additional features
Hellow  Team !!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is Abhishek Bhat here i had created the replica of the BBC Website there i had included the features like chatbots, go to top view, light mode / dark mode through chatbot and getting the hesdlines by read headlines and here i had implemented some more features of the chatbots but unfortunately due to lack of time i couldn't proceded on that so .... and i had already created one more chatbot code i already uploaded in the chat folder u can try out that also 
Thank you for your patience and time

Note:
 Typing "trending news" will filter and show only today's news on the main UI .

Typing "explain today's news" will show those same today's news inside the chatbot itself.

I also added an optional "show all news" command to reset the full news list.

"Activate dark mode" → the site will switch to dark mode.

"Deactivate dark mode" or "Light mode" → it switches back to the default. 

 read headlines used to read only headlines
 
stop reading for stoping
